      In the order of operations, you always multiply or divide numbers before you add or subtract them, ignoring the order they are written.  See if you can solve these problems using that rule:
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <span id = q1>4 + 2 * 3</span> = <input type="text" id="input1">
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <input type="submit">
    </div>
  </form>
<form id="question2">
  
    <div>
      <span id = q2>5+21/7</span> = <input type="text" id="input2">
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <input type="submit">
    </div>
  </form>

     <div class = "lesson">
      When there are parentheses in a series of operations, you always solve the problems that are within parentheses first!  See if you can find the right answers to these:
